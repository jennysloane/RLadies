# R Ladies
I'm very proud to be part of RLadies Sydney! It's such a welcoming and supportive community (...and I love talking and learning about R).

## Gettin Vizzy with it: Tidy Tuesday
Tidy Tuesday is a weekly event where R users around the world explore a unique dataset that is posted [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) every Tuesday. Many people share their findings on twitter with #TidyTuesday. <br><br>
In 2019, R Ladies Sydney had a meet up event called "Gettin Vizzy with it: Tidy Tuesday" and I (nervously) volunteered to live code the latest dataset that was just uploaded. In order to prepare for this event, I downloaded several past datasets and practiced creating visualizations on the spot. I looked at datasets on board games, pizza, and my personal favorite - the world cup. The week of the event, the "cars" dataset was released, so that's the dataset I live coded at the R Ladies event. However, it was not the most exciting dataset, so after my live coding, we switched to a more interesting dataset on pet names for the rest of the event. You can find more information about this event [here](https://rladiessydney.org/events/2019-10-06-events-2019/).

## Show and Tell R
Because we've been unable to hold regular in person meet ups as a result of Covid-19, R Ladies Sydney came up with this awesome idea to host online "Show and Tell" meet ups. During these events, anyone who wants can share what they've been working on in R (or you can just sit back and enjoy the presentations). People share things like:
- complex code for interactive and animated graphs
- simple tricks in R that may come in handy 
- interesting packages that many people have probably never heard of <br>

It's really fun and inspiring to see what other people in the community are working on. My Show and Tell R folder includes R code that I've shared at past meet ups.
